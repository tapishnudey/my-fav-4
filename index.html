        <p>
            A big reason why we love video games so much, I feel, is because they are an escape from our sometimes boring and monotonous lives. Sometimes it’s nice to put on the shoes of a made-up character and forget about all our troubles. I know that after I’ve had a hard day, I come home and put on a headset and play a good game; Action-adventure games are my favorites because I get sucked into the game’s world and forget about everything around me.

    <p id="why_minecraft_is_my_favourit_game">
        My favourit game is minecraft i love it because it is a survival game.It has multiplayer and singleplayer.In multiplayer you can play with your friends or make friends you can survive the monsters that spawn at night and chop wood,trade with villagers,etc.Where as you have to survive alone in singleplayer and kill a dragon who is found at the end dimention  but that's not the end as mincraft has endless possibility.
